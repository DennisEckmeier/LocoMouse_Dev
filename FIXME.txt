Bounding Box:
GENERAL: Implement a choice of bounding box parameters.

FIXME: Normalize this according to box size and framerate.
T = 0.7; % FIXME: Although defined as a percentage, give opportunity to tune.
moving = I_vel > 25; %%% FIXME: This clearly depends on image size. Must be normalized in some way.
D21_mov = sum(D21_mov,1) >= 0.02*prod(box_size_point{1}); %%% FIXME: Find robust values for moving/not moving classification.

%% 	Computing unary potentials for tracking:
% 	FIXME: The classes for the LocoMouse system have been hard coded

%% Tracking 
%FIXME: To generalize the code for other

- include Goncalo's bodymass center calculation
- allow different sets of bounding box settings
