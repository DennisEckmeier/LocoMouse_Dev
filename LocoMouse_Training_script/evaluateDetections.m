function [labels, detection_scores] = evaluateDetections(detections, ground_truth, box_size, threshold)
% EVALUATEDETECTIONS    Checks if the detected boxes are true of false
% positives. Returns unmatched boxes as false negatives.
%
% In this scenario the size of the bounding box is fixed, thus we only need
% to compare the distance between the centers of the detected boxes and
% ground truth.
%
% INPUT:
% detections: a 2xN matrix with the 2D coordinates of N detections.
%
% ground_truth: a 2xG matrix with the 2D coordinates of the G ground
% truth boxes.
%
% box_size: the size of the bounding box. 
%
% threshold: Decision threshold of how close a detected center should be of
% the ground truth to be considered a positive detection. It is defined as
% a percentage of the box size (e.g. if box_size is [10 20] and threshold
% is 0.5, any detection within the sub box of size [5 10] is considered to
% be a true detection).
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% label: a binary NxF matrix which is true/false for true/false positives.
%
% overlap_score: a NxF matrix with the pascal detection score (i.e.
% Area_Intersection/Area_Union)
%
% false_negatives: a binary G-vector which is true when a given ground
% truth box had no detections.
