function mirror_line = computeSplitLine(vid,Bkg,N)
% COMPUTESPLITLINE Computes a horizontal line that splits the top and
% bottom side of an image/video of the LocoMouse setup.
%
% INPUT:
% vid: A video structure from MATLAB
% Bkg: A background image (optional);
% N: How many images to use in the estimation (optional). Default value is
% min(100,vid.NumberOfFrames). Images will be spaced by
% N/vid.NumberOfFrames;
%
% OUPUT:
% mirror_line: A scalar representing the pixel index where the images
% should be split such that Itop = I(1:mirror_line,:); Ibottom =
% I(mirror_line+1:end,:);
%
% The idea behind this function is to sample the whole video and determine
% where in the image the mouse walks. The whole movie is collapsed into
% the mean pixel value of that

% the top and bottom third of the image.

        % supposed to have colour, that happens because of bugs in the 
        % capture code.
